# Designer-Motion
Designing mechanical meta material with specific input/output behavior

First Commit: I wrote Random-Dynamical-Matrix.py
This basically generates a random sparse matrix which is supposed to represent the rigidity
matrix of a spring network. Then from that I minimize the cost(spring-constants) = Energy of desired motion/lowest energy of system.

Second Commit, 10/5/2017 - Thursday: I'm commiting changes to latticeMaking

- This has a bunch of methods for creating a square lattice with diagonal bonds.
- There are also options to randomize the lattice.
- We also create rigidity and dynamical matrices and a few other useful methods. 
- Still working on energy minimization.
