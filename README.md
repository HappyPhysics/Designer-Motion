# Designer-Motion
Designing mechanical meta material with specific input/output behavior

First Commit: I wrote Random-Dynamical-Matrix.py
This basically generates a random sparse matrix which is supposed to represent the rigidity
matrix of a spring network. Then from that I minimize the cost(spring-constants) = Energy of desired motion/lowest energy of system.
